## Project Vision and Objectives
Crypto Market Analysis is a scraper application which will alert individuals about the market changes for 
the cryptocurrency of their choice, and will aim to predict future changes based on information it 
gathers from popular social media sites e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Reddit etc. The current cryptocurrency 
market is volatile and constantly changing, thus timely and accurate information is priceless and can be 
the deciding factor between losing or gaining thousands of Rands.

The core functionality of Crypto Market Analysis involves connecting to the various social media sites, 
and constantly getting information about the state of the cryptocurrency market. This will be done by 
constantly retrieving information when tags relating to the cryptocurrency appears e.g., #bitcoin and by 
identifying when the cryptocurrency has been mentioned in a normal sentence without the use of the 
tag e.g., Bitcoin to the moon. This will allow the application to understand what the state of the market 
is and inform the user if it is about to change.
